Cleanup
-------
Fix the memory leak around the growing scratch buffer size in matmul.cpp
Clean up the code, get it workable for a third party, write a good README

Usability
---------
Why does the first iteration after a prompt has finished take so long?
Deal with the initial prompt exceding the maxSequenceLength size.
Deal with exceeding the cacheSize limit.
Reevaluate the need to convert the model files twice, or combine into a single step.
Write performance numbers to a file, use the curses library to display text as it is generated like chatgpt does

Performance
-----------
Calculate bandwidth utilization when seqlen=1 and Gflops when seqlen>1
Write matvec kernels for multi-head situation in K^T Q and V * (K^T Q)
It would be good to have a model server that could give the pre-made MetalBuffers to another program since loading takes so long.

New models
----------
Modify code to deal with the repeated heads in the 34b parameter model
Collect statistics on the input to each matrix multiply for finding quantization parameters
